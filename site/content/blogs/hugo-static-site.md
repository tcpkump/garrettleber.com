description: "My experience building a static site with Hugo and github actions"
---

I've toyed with many ways of creating static websites over the years. I've done
bare HTML/CSS with no frameworks, I've used bootstrap, I've used Jekyll, and
I've used Hugo. One thing that has been consistent is my hosting via S3 and
Cloudfront (among other pieces). Out of all of the static sites I've developed,
Hugo has been my favorite. It's fast, easy to use, and has a large community.
For the theme, I chose
[Hugo-Profile](https://github.com/gurusabarish/hugo-profile) because it allows
me to have a clean homepage with a resume (both in HTML and PDF format) and a
blog. I also like the fact that it's a single page application, so it's fast
and easy to navigate.

## My experience with Hugo

I'll admit there has been a little bit of a learning curve with Hugo. I started
out by following the
[quickstart](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) guide, and then I
swapped out the theme. This is where I started to actually develop my site.

Immediately, the Hugo-Profile documentation advises you to `git clone` directly
into your themes directory. I did this, but encountered issues later when I
wanted to commit my changes to my own repository. This led me to learning about
git submodules, which are pretty neat. I had to remove the hugo-profile repo
from my theme directory and simply readd it as a submodule. This allows me to
commit my changes to my own repo, and pull in updates from the hugo-profile
repo.

The necessary command to do this is:

```bash git submodule add https://github.com/gurusabarish/hugo-profile.git
themes/hugo-profile ```

Once you have the theme, I think it is normal to dive into loading your content
onto the landing page, which is what I started doing. I did this a bit
manually, copying info from my previous site and pasting it in, formatting it
as markdown. One custom thing I keep around on my sites is a visitor counter I
developed as part of the [Cloud Resume
Challenge](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/) so this led me down a rabbit hole
of customizing the footer on my Hugo theme. Hugo has a system built-in where
you can override the default theme files by creating your own files in the same
directory structure. This is what I did to override the footer. I created a
`layouts/partials/sections/footer/copyright.html` file and added my custom code
there. This worked great, and I was able to get my visitor counter working. One
downside I see for this is that I won't get any updates to the footer from the
theme, but I'm not too worried about that.

## Adding a blog

The theme comes out of the box with a link to a blog, but it doesn't actually
have a blog. I wanted to add a blog, so I started by following the hugo docs to
add a new page.

The necessary command to do this is:

```bash hugo new blogs/hugo-static-site.md ```

Then I got to typing this page up, how fun.

## Adding github actions

This took quite a bit of tweaking/iterations to get through, and I still see
room for improvement.

I started with a simple action to build and push my Hugo site to s3. This
worked flawlessly. Adding CloudFront invalidation was also pretty easy. At this
point I had a separated frontend and backend repo structure, and therefore I
was hardcoding several values in my frontend to connect things (s3 Bucket,
CloudFront Distribution ID, Visitor Counter API URL). This didn't feel right,
and ended up with me down quite the rabbit hole.

I moved my infrastructure code into the same repo as the frontend (eventually
renaming it, now all code for my site is in one monorepo). This made it much
easier to couple my Hugo builds with outputs from my infrastructure code
(Terraform). There isn't native support in hugo for passing configuration
parameters as environment variables or command line flags, so I had to get a
bit creative here. My solution looks like this (all in github actions):

1. Terraform deploys the infrastructure and outputs the necessary values to a
   json file, which is then uploaded as an artifact
2. In my Hugo build job, I download the artifact and parse the json file to get
   the values I need
3. Said values are injected into my config.yaml file using `sed` (I know, I
   know, but it works)
4. Hugo builds the site, and stores the `public` directory as an artifact
5. In my Hugo deploy job, I download the artifact and upload it to s3

This has been working pretty well thusfar, and I think it lays some good
groundwork for me to implement some testing in the future (both for my
infrastructure and my frontend).

## Conclusion

I'm pretty happy with how my site turned out. I think it's a good balance of
simple and functional, while leaving room for me to add more features in the
future.

If you are interested, everything for this site is open source and available on

post, and I hope you enjoy my site!
