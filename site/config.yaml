    title: "About Me"
    #image: "/images/hero-bg.jpg"
    content: |-
      I consider myself a software engineer with a specialization in infrastructure, which tends to be a DevOps role. Most of my experience is with GCP, but I have also worked with AWS. 
      
      I have experience in broad areas of infrastructure, including:

      - Infrastructure as Code
      - CI/CD
      - Configuration Management
      - Monitoring
      - Logging
      - Databases

      I also have experience in more specialized areas. I have several years of experience in networking, previously being CCNA certified. A couple of those years were in network security, specifically doing deep packet inpection and intrusion detection.
